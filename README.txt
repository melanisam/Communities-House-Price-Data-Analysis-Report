Overview
This code provides our detailed analysis and findings for our research question: “To what extent do the features in the Victorian Communities Dataset predict housing prices?”. Our analysis is composed of 3 major sections, Pre-processing, Exploratory data analysis and modelling (consisting of a decision tree and 2 linear regression models)

Files Used: 
communities.csv and Houses-by-suburb.csv

Python Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- re
- matplotlib.pyplot
- json
- sklearn.preprocessing
- sklearn.model_selection
- sklearn.tree
- sklearn.metrics
- sklearn.linear_model

Usage 
To reproduce the results and findings of our analysis, download ‘final.ipynb’, ‘communities.csv’ and ‘Houses-by-suburb.csv’, and use software such as Visual Studio Code to load the Jupyter Notebook ‘final.ipynb’. Running the Jupyter Notebook will reproduce all the results that were obtained in our analysis, including the json files ‘houseSeries.json’ and ‘houseSeries2.json’.
